# Inventory-Management-Application

To run this program, simply run the FlaskApp.py file and it will create the webpage for your usage. You will be brought to the main menu where you may select the item management (for inventory items) and warehouse management (for managing/adding/removing warehouses). Clicking on either links will bring you to their respective page and if you would like to go back to the main menu, click on the main menu button under the form for submission.

Additional Note: If you would like to initialize the database yourself and not use the available database, then run database.py and then run FlaskApp.py.

Be sure to press the "open in new tab" option at the top right of the browser preview to see the webpage without any formatting issues.
